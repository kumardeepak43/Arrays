<!-- Even Odd
You are given an array A containing N integer elements, and your task is to return an array B
 
(having a size equal to 2), where B [0] contains the sum of all even elements of array A and B[1]
 has the sum of all odd elements of the array A.

 Note: You have to complete findEvenOdd function. No need to take any input -->

 <!-- const findEvenOdd = (N, Arr) => 
{
    let result = [0,0];
    for (let i = 0; i < N; i++){
      if(Arr[i] % 2 === 0){
        result[0] += Arr[i];
      
      }
      else{
          result[1] += Arr[i];
      }
    }
    return result;
